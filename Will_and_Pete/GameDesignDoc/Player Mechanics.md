#Player
## [[Player Movement]]

Movement should be snappy and controllable.
Double jump and wall slide for together with world environment should provide a multitude of ways to get to their target.
### Walk/Run
The player can move left and right on the ground and in the air.
The player can move less direct when in the air.

### Jump
Players can do up to 2 Jumps


### Wall Slide / Jump
When jumping against a wall. The player can repress the jump input to jump diagonally off the wall.
Jumping off the wall reduces air control significantly for a short duration.
This helps the player jump further in the direction they want while simultaneously blocking them from just reattaching to the same wall again. 
When the player is tight against a wall and moving *against* it they will fall slower in a sliding animation.

## [[Player Shooting]]
Both Players Share a rifle.
We want the Characters to be able to throw the rifle.
