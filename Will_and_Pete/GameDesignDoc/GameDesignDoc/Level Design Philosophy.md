I was thinking of capturing the general feeling of Left4Dead level structure

Start in a safe location and move on from there

Sneak and fight through the level

Alerting enemies is punished

Special enemies who are able to pin down or control a player. Sticking together is important but not necessary.

Include some obstacles in the map that are Points of no return. The players should always try to traverse these together or face losing a member on the other side.

Get to the next "safe room"

  

what about collectibles rewarding exploration?
